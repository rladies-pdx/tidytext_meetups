For our second book club book, we'll be reading Cathy O'Neil's 'Weapons of Math Destruction'! Here's a quick review:</p> <p>“O’Neil’s book offers a frightening look at how algorithms are increasingly regulating people… Her knowledge of the power and risks of mathematical models, coupled with a gift for analogy, makes her one of the most valuable observers of the continuing weaponization of big data… [She] does a masterly job explaining the pervasiveness and risks of the algorithms that regulate our lives.”<br/>—New York Times Book Review</p> <p>This book is available <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019B6VCLO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"">on Amazon</a> or from local booksellers like <a href=""http://www.bookpeople.com/book/9780553418835"">Book People</a>. </p> <p>Agenda: We'll meet at Thunderbird Coffee on Koenig at 6:30, where we'll discuss the book and discussion questions over beverages (they have beer and coffee/tea drinks). Looking forward to seeing you all!</p> ",,public,,0,,24346740,Thunderbird Coffee,30.33079719543457,-97.73198699951172,FALSE,1401 Koenig Ln. ,Austin,us,USA,"",TX,1485879617e3,R-Ladies Austin,22180445,open,30.219999313354492,-97.75,rladies-austin,Members,"Austin, TX",en_US
