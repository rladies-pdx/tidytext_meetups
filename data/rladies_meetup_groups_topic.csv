Midwest’s first R Programming Community for Women! We are aiming to bring together women at all R proficiency levels living in/or near Columbus, Ohio. Members can have different motivations such as:</p> 
<p> “I want to learn R”,</p> 
<p> “I want to switch to R”,</p> 
<p> “I am an expert and want to share my expertise”,</p> 
<p> “I am looking for a co-developer for my R package”.</p> 
<p>No matter what your motivation is and how well you use R, we would like to see you among us. All events are FREE</p> 
<p>Meetup structure will be shaped by interests and skill sets of members, however here are some potential topics (partial credit to R-Ladies London group):</p> 
<p> Kickstarting R &amp; RStudio</p> 
<p> Importance/Relevance of R skills (use-cases, jobs/roles, salaries)</p> 
<p> Data Visualization</p> 
<p> Multilevel Modeling</p> 
<p> Handling Missing Data Using R</p> 
<p>Leadership and mentoring roles are reserved for women and nonbinary people, and men are welcome to attend meetings as guests.

<p><b>Code of Conduct</b></p>
<p>R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This code of conduct applies to all R-Ladies spaces, including meetups, Twitter, Slack, mailing lists, both online and offline. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Founding Members. Some R-Ladies spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. </p>
<p><b>Harassment includes: </b></p>
<p>● Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. </p>
<p>● Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment. </p>
<p>● Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names. </p>
<p>● Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate. ● Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop. 4 </p>
<p>● Threats of violence </p>
<p>● Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm. </p>
<p>● Deliberate intimidation </p>
<p>● Stalking or following </p>
<p>● Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes. </p>
<p>● Sustained disruption of discussion </p>
<p>● Unwelcome sexual attention </p>
<p>● Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others. </p>
<p>● Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease. </p>
<p>● Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse. </p>
<p>● Publication of non-harassing private communication. R-Ladies prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The Founding Members will not act on complaints regarding: </p>
<p>● ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’ </p>
<p>● Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.” </p>
<p>● Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial </p>
<p>● Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions Reporting If you are being harassed by a member/guest/participant of/at R-Ladies, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Founding Members via reporting@rladies.org. Local incidences will be handled together with the local organisers. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can. This code of conduct applies to R-Ladies spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member/guest/participant of/at R-Ladies outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by R-Ladies members, especially the 5 Founding Members, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The Founding Members reserve the right to exclude people from R-Ladies based on their past behavior, including behavior outside R-Ladies spaces and behavior towards people who are not in R-ladies. In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of R-Ladies members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>
<p><b>Consequences </b></p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Founding Members may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all R-Ladies spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other R-Ladies members or the general public. </p>

<p><b>R-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote Gender Diversity in the R community.</b></p>
<p>The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of Women* in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educations, or users (see recent stats). As a diversity initiative, R-Ladies’ mission is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering the minorities currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladies’ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting the R enthusiasts who identify as an underrepresented minority to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>R-Ladies Porto Alegre is part of a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community, R-Ladies Global. We are a network of women R practitioners in Porto Alegre. Our goals are to provide a supportive and encouraging network for R users who identify as female and to promote learning and collaboration in the R community. We are emphatically LGBTQ friendly and open to any women interested in programming in R, from experts to novices. Join us!</p>
<p>Community Policies &amp; Code of Conduct: the leadership, mentoring &amp; teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by females (male speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as female, and we therefore reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deem appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team. Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community. By taking part in an R-Ladies event you grant the community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community’s aims.

1,26556368,R-Ladies Cambridge,active,https://www.meetup.com/rladies-cambridge/,rladies-cambridge,"<p>A local chapter of R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Cambridge exists to promote diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities (which many lead R-Ladies are) - our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.</p>
<p>R-Ladies Cambridge welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking &amp; expert upskilling. Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members' R skills &amp; knowledge through social, collaborative learning &amp; sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills &amp; careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community! @RLadiesGlobal | info [at] rladies.org (email) | rladies.org (website) | github.com/rladies</p>
<p>PS Community Policies &amp; Code of Conduct: the leadership, mentoring &amp; teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deem appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Seattle is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team. Full community guidelines are found here: <a href=""https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki</a>...</p>
